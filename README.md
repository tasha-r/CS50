# CS50
The purpose of this repository is to store my solutions to the problem sets given by the CS50 introduction to Computer Science course. Even though this is a beginners course to programming and I have used all the technologies listed in the syllabus before, I am interested to see what content and skills it covers. The course syllabus can be found at https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/syllabus.html

### Problem Set 0
To run the .sb2 solution file created for problem set 0, download the file, head to 
https://scratch.mit.edu and click the 'Create' button located at the top of the screen. Find the 'File -> Upload 
from your computer' option, select the .sb2 file and press the green flag. By toggling the squares on the screen, 
you will trigger different sounds to play when the black line sprite is touching them.
